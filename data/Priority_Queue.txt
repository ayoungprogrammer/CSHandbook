## Introduction

*Prerequisites*: [[Queue]], [[Heap]]

A priority queue is a queue that pops elements that are the maximum or minimum of a property and are usually implemented as heaps.

Consider a waiting list for lung donors. The patients are given a score when they are placed on the waiting list by how much they need a lung based on their whether they smoke, risk factors, age, expected time left etc. When a lung is available, the patient with the highest score will get removed from the waiting list. During this time, more patients could be added to the queue. The behaviour is similar to a queue but instead of the first person getting in the queue getting a lung first, the person with the highest score will get it. This means that if Sam has a score of 60 and gets placed in the queue after Bob who has a score of 40, Sam will get the lung first even though Bob was in the queue before him. 

A **priority queue** is an abstract data structure with two operations: push and pop. Push adds an element into the priority queue and pop removes the highest or lowest element.

A priority queue is usually implemented as a heap because it is the most efficient because of its structure.

## Implementation

Implementation | Push | Pop
-----------|---------|--
[[Heap]]  | O(log n) | O(log n)

## Applications

Priority queues are very efficient in its opertions O(log n) and it is used in many other algorithms such as:

* [[Dijkstra's]]
* [[Prim's]]
* [[Kruskal]]
* [[Line Sweeping]]

## Exercises

1. Given a list of N numbers, find the M largest numbers. (Note you can do better than O(N log N))
2. Given N lists of N numbers, find the N largest numbers.
