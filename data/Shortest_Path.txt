## Introduction

*Prerequisites*: [[Graph Theory]]

The shortest path is defined as a path from one node to another while trying to minimize a certain property (least number of nodes, smallest total weight). However, shortest paths may have negative weights which leads to cycles. 

## Implementations

| Algorithm | Time | Detect cycles?
|----------|----|------|-----|----------
|[[Floyd Warshall]] |  O(N^^3^^) | Yes
|[[Bellman Ford]] |  O(N^^2^^) | Yes
|[[Dijkstra's]]  | O(N log N) | No

* [[Floyd Warshall]] computes the shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
* [[Bellman Ford]] computes the shortest path between one node to every other node.
* [[Dijkstra's]] computes the shortest path between two nodes.
