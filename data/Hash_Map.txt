Hash maps are maps that use [[hash sets|Hash sets]] to store the keys. 

## Implementation

Here is a Java implementation of a hash map which is a modified version of a [[hash set]].

### Class

Inside our implementation of a hash map we will store the buckets using an array of linked lists, the number of buckets, and the number of elements in the set. 

The collision chance is the threshold for resizing the hash set. When the ratio of elements in the set to number of buckets is greater than the threshold, then the chance of collision will be high enough that it will slow down the operations. The lower this ratio, the better performing a hash set will be.

[[[[
public class HashMap {

	public LinkedList<Pair>[] buckets;
	public int bucketsSize = 10;
	public int size = 0;
	public static final double COLLISION_CHANCE = 0.3;
	
	public HashMap(){
		buckets = new LinkedList[10];
		for(int i=0;i<bucketsSize;i++){
			buckets[i] = new LinkedList<Pair>();
		}
		size = 0;
	}
}
]]]]

### Hash

The hash code is the result of the hashing algorithm for an element. In our hash set implementation, we will use a simple hash: modulus of the integer by the number of buckets. 

For the most part if the numbers are all random then the hash function is fine. However, if the number of buckets was 10 and we added the elements 20,30,40,50,60,70, they will all end up in the same bucket and results in poor performance.

[[[[
public int getHash(int x,int hashSize){
	return x % hashSize;
}
]]]]

### Resize

A hash map must be able to resize. When the ratio of number of elements to number of buckets, the chance of collision will increase more and more. So we must able to resize the number of buckets to support the number of elements to lower the chance of collision.

To resize efficiently, we can create two times the number of buckets and set them to empty and then insert all the elements in the old buckets to the new buckets.

[[[[
public void resize(){
	int newBucketsSize = bucketsSize*2;
	LinkedList<Pair>[] newBuckets = new LinkedList[newBucketsSize];
	for(int i=0;i<newBucketsSize;i++){
		newBuckets[i] = new LinkedList<Pair>();
	}
	for(int i=0;i<bucketsSize;i++){
		for(Pair p:buckets[i]){
			int hash = getHash(p.key,newBucketsSize);
			newBuckets[hash].push(p);
		}
	}
	buckets = newBuckets;
	bucketsSize = newBucketsSize;
}
]]]]

### Insert

To insert an element in a hash set, we get the hash code from our hashing algorithm and insert the element into the corresponding bucket.

The function will return method or not the operation was successful. If the bucket already contains the element the operation will stop because we do not want to add duplicate elements into the set. If the bucket does not contain the element, we will insert it into the bucket and the operation is successful.

[[[[
public boolean insert(Pair p){
	int hash = getHash(p.key,bucketsSize);
	
	LinkedList<Pair> curBucket = buckets[hash];
	if(curBucket.contains(p.key)){
		return false;
	}
	curBucket.push(p);
	if( (float)size/bucketsSize>COLLISION_CHANCE){
		resize();
	}
	size++;
	return true;
}
]]]]

### Get

To get the value from a hash set from a key, we get the hash code from our hashing algorithm of the key and find the key-value pair in the corresponding bucket.


[[[[
public Pair get(int key){
	int hash = getHash(key,bucketsSize);
	LinkedList<Pair> curBucket = buckets[hash];
	for(Pair p:curBucket){
		if(p.key==key){
			return p;
		}
	}
	return null;
}
]]]]

### Remove

To remove an element from a hash set, we get the hash code from our hashing algorithm and remove the element from the corresponding bucket.

The function will return whether or not the operation was successful. If the bucket contains the element we can remove it from the linked list and the operation is successful. If the element is not in the bucket then the operation fails because we cannot remove something that is not there.


[[[[
public boolean remove(int key){
	int hash = getHash(key,bucketsSize);
	
	LinkedList<Pair> curBucket = buckets[hash];
	for(Pair p: curBucket){
		if(p.key==key){
			curBucket.remove(p);
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}
]]]]

## Exercises

1. Create a hash map for the English dictionary (word as keys, definition as value). You will need to create a hash function for strings.
