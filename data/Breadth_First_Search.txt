## Introduction

A breadth first search is a search that transverses level by level. For example in a tree, it will transverse everything from the first layer, to the second layer etc. BFS requires a queue to search. BFS memory limitations depends on how wide a layer is. If layers are too wide but the depth is short, then consider using DFS.

## Implementation

Printing a binary tree using BFS:

[[[[
void bfs(Node root){
    Queue<Node> q = new Queue<Node>();
    q.push(root);
    while(q.isEmpty()==false){
        Node cur = q.pop();
        System.out.println(cur.value);
        if(cur.left)q.push(cur.left);
        if(cur.right)q.push(cur.right);
    }
}
]]]]

## Exercises

1. Given a grid of squares with walls at certain locations and two locations A and B, find the minimum distance (going up/left/right/down) between the locations or impossible otherwise. For example if A is at (1,1) and B is at (3,1) but there is a wall at (2,1) then the minimum distance would be 4 (down, left, left, up). 
2. Given a tree of letters (A is the root), output the tree using BFS with separators between levels
  * Example: A->B, B->D,B->C, C->G will output A | B | C D | G 
3. Given a tree of letters, and two letters X and Y determine if X is an ancestor of Y or Y is a ancestor of X or neither. An ancestor of a node is another node that is the root of a subtree that contains that node. Or simply parent of the node, grand parent, great grandparents etc.
  * Example: A->B, B->C, B->D, D->G,  A is a parent of both C and D but G and C are not ancestors of each other
4. Given a binary tree and a node in the binary tree, find the next node in BFS order of the tree.
