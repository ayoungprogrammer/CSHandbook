## Introduction

**Prerequisites**:  [[Priority Queue]], [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.

If implemented efficiently using a priority queue, the runtime is O(n log n).

## Implementation

Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree using a greedy fashion. It works as such:

1. Pick an arbitrary node.
2. Find the closest node to that node.
3. Find the closest node to the 2 nodes.
4. Find the closest node to the 3 nodes.
5. ...
6. Find the closest node to n-1 nodes.

The closest node is the node with the lowest cost edge to the already connected nodes.

### Example

Suppose we have the following graph and we would like the find the minimum spanning tree.

{{prim.png}}

We can start at any random node so this example, we will start at 1.

{{prim1.png}}

The closest unpicked node to all the chosen nodes is 2 at a cost of 2.

{{prim2.png}}

The closest unpicked node to all the chosen nodes is 7 at a cost of 6.

{{prim3.png}}

The closest unpicked node to all the chosen nodes is 5 at a cost of 6.

{{prim4.png}}

The closest unpicked node to all the chosen nodes is 4 at a cost of 6.
{{prim5.png}}

The closest unpicked node to all the chosen nodes is 6 at a cost of 8.
{{prim6.png}}

The last node to be chosen is 3 with a cost of 8.

### Java Code

We can implement Prim's algorithm in Java efficiently with a priority queue of edges using the weight as the comparing property.

[[[[
class node implements Comparable<node> {
  int weight, index;
  public node(int weight, int index) {
    this.weight = weight;
    this.index = index;
  }
  public int compareTo(node e) {
    return weight - e.weight;
  }
}
public static int Prims(Vector<Vector<node>> adjList) {
  // Current cost of MST.
  int cost = 0;
  int n = adjList.size();
  
  PriorityQueue<node> pq = new PriorityQueue<node>();
  
  // Keep track if each node is visited.
  boolean visited[] = new boolean[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    visited[i] = false;
  }
  
  // Number of nodes visited.
  int inTree = 1;
  
  // Mark starting node as visited.
  visited[0] = true;
  
  // Add all edges of starting node.
  for (int i = 0; i < adjList.get(0).size(); i++) {
    pq.add(adjList.get(0).get(i));
  }
  // Keep going until all nodes visited.
  while (!pq.isEmpty() && inTree < n) {
    // Get the edge with the smallest weight.
    node cur = pq.poll();
    // Skip if node already used.
    if (visited[cur.index]) {
      continue;
    }
    inTree++;
    visited[cur.index] = true;
    cost += cur.weight;
    // Add all the edges of the new node to the priority queue.
    for (int i = 0; i < adjList.get(cur.index).size(); i++) {
      pq.add(adjList.get(cur.index).get(i));
    }
  }
  // Graph not connected if number of nodes used is less than total nodes.
  if (inTree < n) {
    return -1;
  }

  return cost;
}
]]]]

## Exercises

1. Prove that Prim's algorithm works.
2. Extends Prim's to output all the edges used.
