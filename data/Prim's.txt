A [[minimum spanning tree|Minimum Spanning Tree]] is a tree in a graph that connects all the nodes using the smallest cost total cost of edges. 

Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree using a greedy fashion. It works as such:

1. Pick an arbitrary node
2. Find the closest node to that node
3. Find the closest node to the 2 nodes
4. Find the closest node to the 3 nodes
5. ...
6. Find the closest node to n-1 nodes

The closest node is the node with the lowest cost edge to the already connected nodes.

### Implementation

In Java, we need to specify a comparison for the Priority Queue to order. We do this be implementing the Comparable class and overriding the compareTo method. 

adjList is an [[adjacency list|Adjacency List]] that is an array of arrays that store the graph. 

[[[[

class node implements Comparable<node>{
	int weight,index;
	public node(int weight,int index){
		this.weight = weight;
		this.index = index;
	}
	public int compareTo(node e){
		return weight-e.weight;
	}
}
public static int Prims(Vector<Vector<node>> adjList){
	int cost = 0;
	int n = adjList.size();
	PriorityQueue<node> pq = new PriorityQueue<node>();
	boolean visited[] = new boolean[n];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		visited[i] = false;
	}
	int inTree = 1;
	visited[0] = true;
	for(int i=0;i<adjList.get(0).size();i++){
		pq.add(adjList.get(0).get(i));
	}
	while(!pq.isEmpty()&&inTree<n){
		node cur = pq.poll();
		if(visited[cur.index])continue;
		inTree++;
		visited[cur.index]=true;
		cost+=cur.weight;
		for(int i=0;i<adjList.get(cur.index).size();i++){
			pq.add(adjList.get(cur.index).get(i));			
                 }
	}
	//Graph is not connected
	if(inTree<n)return -1;
	return cost;
}
]]]]

### Applications

In networking, if a cable company wanted to connect all the houses with the least amount of wiring, the minimum spanning tree can be found that finds the least total cost of wire. 

Minimum spanning trees can also be used in generating mazes.

### Exercises

1. Prove that Prim's algorithm works
2. Extends Prim's to output all the edges used
3. Given a weighted graph with n nodes, find the smallest total cost to connect all nodes into 3 separate groups. (A single node can be a group)
4. Same as 3, but a group must contain at least 3 other nodes.
