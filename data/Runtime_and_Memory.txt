## Introduction

Processing time and memory are two primary resources that computer programs use and it is important to analyze the limits we have. Computers are super fast at making calculations compared to humans, but humans have much more "memory" than computers currently do. For example, computers can add two 100-digit numbers together much more quickly than any human possibly can. However, the human brain can contain much more memory than computers.

Brains have trillions of connections between neurons and the estimated storage capacity is about 2.5 petabytes. That is approximately 340 years of TV shows that you could watch! Computers on the other hand, have much less memory than human brains. Standard computers have around 8GB of RAM and some higher end machines may have 16-32GB. Although hard-disks can store terabytes of memory, we use RAM (flash memory) when analyzing computer memory because it is much faster than disk storage. As an analogy, RAM can be thought of as grabbing an object in another room whereas disk memory is driving 20 min away to get that object. 

The neurons and connections in our brains allow us to store an immense amount of information in our brains and allows us to easily recognize patterns much better than computers. For example it is very easy for us to identify different objects around us (e.g. we can easily differentiate between an apple and an orange), but it is difficult for a computer to do this for the countless number of objects in the world. However this is currently changing as more research is being done in "deep learning".

Note that a computer is 1,000,000,000 times faster than humans but humans can store 100,000 times more information (approx. 340 years of TV shows).
## Limits

There are many different methods of implementing different things but most of the time we care most about implementations that are the fastest and use the least amount of memory. Let's go through some basic benchmarks about computers that you should know. Adding two numbers takes a nanosecond (1 billionth of a second) for an average computer to process. For practical purposes, we'll assume that the average computer program can hold up to 1GB or RAM or about 250 million integers. We use RAM because it is flash memory and read/write is super fast in comparison to disk read/writes.

## Big O Notation

When we compare how efficient algorithms or data structures are to another, we want to be able to describe them such that they can be quantified. We use something called Big O notation to do this. Many algorithms and data structures will have its time and space complexities depend on the size of the inputs. The Big O notation takes the largest factor of an input to compare computation times / memory usage. When we take the largest factor, we ignore smaller factors, coefficients and constants because they do not matter at very large values. For example: O(3n^^2^^ + 12n + 20) is simply O(n^^2^^) because it is the largest factor.

Here is a list of common Big O notations based on complexity:

Big O | Limit of N for 1 second (Standard processor)
-|-
O(1) *Constant Time* | runtime independent of N
O(log N) *Sublinear time* | a very big number
O(N) *Linear Time* | 100,000,000
O(N log N) | 5,000,000
O(N^^2^^) *Quadratic Time* | 10000
O(N^^3^^) *Cubic Time* | 450
O(2^^N^^) *Exponential Time* | 27
O(N!) *Factorial Time* | 11

Keep in mind that in a couple of years as technology improves, this chart will be outdated.

## Runtime Analysis

Let us examine a function that takes in an array of size N and returns the maximum element. In a program we are usually concerned with two complexities: memory and time. 

Code:

[[[[
int findMax(int[] array){
  int maxVal = array[0]; //O(1) memory to store max element, O(1) time for assignment
  for(int i=1;i<array.length;i++){ //O(n) loop runtime
      if(maxVal < array[i]){ //O(1) to compare runtime
         maxVal = array[i]; //O(1) to assign new value runtime
     }
  }
}
]]]]

Memory: The array takes O(N) memory and storing the max value is O(1) more memory. but usually when analyzing programs, we ignore the input memory sizes and take into account additional memory that is required to produce the output. So the memory footprint of the function is O(1).

Time: The first assignment of maxVal takes O(1). The loop runs N-1 times and of each of those N-1 times it checks if the current array element is greater than the current max which takes O(1). If it is greater, then we reassign maxVal which is O(1). When analyzing time complexity, we usually take worst case so we have: O(1+(N-1)(2)) and this simplifies to O(N) since it is the largest factor.

### Example

Suppose we have a function that zeroes a 2D NxN array.

[[[[
void zeroArrays(int[][] grid){
  //O(n) loop
  for(int i=0; i<grid.length;i++){
    //O(n) loop
    for(int j=0;j<grid[i].length;j++){
      //O(1)
      grid[i][j] = 0;
    }
  }
}
]]]]

There are NxN cells we need to set to 0 so we need O(N^^2^^) operations. We can also think of it as another way. There are two nested loop and each loop is O(n) so we multiply them and O(n) x O(n) = O(n^^2^^). Generally, when we have nested loops, we multiple their complexities. 

### Example

Suppose we have another function that prints out the binary backwards for each number from 1 to N.

[[[[
void binaryNumbers(int n){
    for(int x = 1; x < n; x++){
        int bin = x;
        while(bin > 0){
            System.out.print(bin % 2);
            bin = bin / 2;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
]]]]

For each number x, it will take O(log x) to convert the number to binary and we do this N times so the runtime is: O(n log n).
