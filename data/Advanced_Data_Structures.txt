## Introduction

Advanced data structures are data structures that are very specific in performing a single task and they usually require more time to implement.

## [[Trees]]

Trees are data structures that follow a hierarchy, each node has exactly one or zero parents and each node has children. 

Trees are recursive structures meaning that each child of a tree is also a tree. 

A tree within another tree is called a **subtree**.

A **child** is a node that is below another node. A **parent** is a node that is above another node.

The element at the top of the tree with no parents is called a **root**. The node at the bottom of the tree with no children is called a **leaf**. 

Each node can hold different kinds of information depending on the tree. A node can hold the children it has, the parent it has, a key associated with the node and a value associated with the node. 

### B-tree

A B-tree is a tree that keeps data sorted, insertions and deletions in O(log n) time.

### Binary Indexed Tree

### [[AVL Tree]]

An AVL tree is a self balancing [[binary tree|Binary Tree]].

### Red Black Tree

### Segment Tree

### Interval Tree

### Splay Tree

## [[Heap]]

### Fibonacci Heap

### Binomial Heap

## Trie

A trie is tree which stores strings by their prefixes. A trie can replace a set for storing strings as it is faster than a hash set and it can the stored strings sorted but it takes more memory.

Let m be the length of the string.
