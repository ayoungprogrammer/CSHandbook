## Introduction

A subsequence is a subset of the original sequence that is in the same order. For example in the string "abcdefghi", "aeg" is a subsequence but "eaq" is not because it is not in order.

The longest common subsequence between two strings A and B is the longest subsequence in A that is also in B.

For example given A="xyaaaabcdeg", B="bcaaaaefgxy" the longest common subsequence is "aaaaeg"

[[[[{lang-html}
xyaaaabcde_g
bcaaaa___efgxy
]]]]

If we try to use greedy we will see it doesn't work. For example if we use try to take as much as B as we can, we see that we will get BCEG or if we try to take as much as A we get XY.

## Solution

Let first write a formal definition of the problem, given two strings A and B each with lengths N and M respectively we want to find the longest common subsequence between them.

**[Note to make reading easier I have used short forms for substring and index. For example A[3] means the 3rd character of A and A[1..4] means the substring of A from the first character to the fourth character inclusive. A[0] represents the null substring of A]**

The base is simple. The LCS of A[1..x] (where x is from 1 to N) and B[0] = 0. The LCS of B[1..x] and A[0] = 0.

We need to break this problem into subproblems. 

If A[N] = B[M] and then the new LCS is the LCS of A[1..N-1] and B[1..M-1]. Note that if two strings have the same character at the end of their string it has to be part of the LCS. Try to prove this to yourself.

[[[[{lang-html}
LCS of matched = (LCS of A from 1 to N-1, B from 1 to M-1) + A[N]
]]]]

If A[N] != B[M] then we try to match A[N] with B[M-1] or A[N-1] with B[M]. Thus we take the LCS of A[1..N-1] and B[1..M] and the LCS of A[1..N] and B[1..M-1].

[[[[{lang-html}
LCS of not matched = max ( (LCS of A[1..N], B[1..M-1]) , (LCS of A[1..N-1],B[1..M]))
]]]]

Putting it all together we have:
[[[[{lang-html}
Let LCS[i][j] be the length of longest common subsequence of A[1..i] and B[1..j] where 0< i ≤ n and 0 < j ≤ m.

Base case:
LCS[i][0] = 0 where 0< i ≤ n
LCS[0][j] = 0 where 0< j ≤ m

Subproblem:
if A[i] == B[j], LCS[i][j] = LCS[i-1][j-1]+1 where 0< i ≤ n and 0 < j ≤ m
if A[i] != B[j], LCS[i][j] = max( LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1] ) where 0< i ≤ n and 0 < j ≤ m
]]]]
