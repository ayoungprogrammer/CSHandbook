## Introduction

**Prerequisites**:  [[Shortest Path]], [[Dynamic Programming]]

Floyd Warshall is a algorithm for finding the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes in a graph. The algorithm has a runtime of O(n^^3^^) and is able to detect cycles.


## Implementation

Floyd-Warshall uses a [[dynamic programming|Dynamic Programming]] approach to finding the shortest path between node A and node B. Every path from node A to node B can be rewritten as a path from A to some node in between plus the path from the node in between to node B. The shortest path from A to B can be found by finding a node C such the shortest path from A to C plus the shortest path from C to B is minimized.

### Formalization

Here is a recursive definition of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:

[[[[
Given a directed graph with N nodes and edges between nodes:
Let edge(i,j) be the weight of the edge from node i to node j in the graph
Let shortestPath(i,j) be the shortest path from i to j

Base Case:
shortestPath(i,i) = 0

Recursion:
shortestPath(i,j) =  minimum of:
       minimum of (shortestPath(i,k) + shortestPath(k,j) for all unvisited nodes k)
       edge(i,j) if exists
]]]]

### Code

[[[[
class edge {
  int weight, source, dest;
  public edge(int source, int dest, int weight) {
    this.source = source;
    this.dest = dest;
    this.weight = weight;
  }
}
public static final int UNDEFINED = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

public static int[][] FloydWarshall(Vector<Vector<edge>> adjList) {
  int n = adjList.size();
  // Let dist[i][j] be the minimum distance from i to j.
  int[][] dist = new int[n][n];

  // Initialize all minimum distances to be undefined.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      dist[i][j] = UNDEFINED;
    }
  }

  // The minimum distance from a node to itself is 0.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    dist[i][i] = 0;
  }

  // Set distances for each edge.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < adjList.get(i).size(); j++) {
      edge e = adjList.get(i).get(j);
      dist[e.source][e.dest] = e.weight;
    }
  }

  // Iterate through each intermediate node.
  for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    // Iterate through each starting node.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // Iterate through each ending node.
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // If there is a path from i to k and k to j.
        if (dist[i][k] != UNDEFINED && dist[k][j] != UNDEFINED) {
          // Distance from i to j is distance from i to k plus distance from k
          // to j.
          int newDist = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
          // Update distance from i to j, if the new distance is less than
          // current distance or if there is no existing path from i to j.
          if (dist[i][j] > newDist || dist[i][j] == UNDEFINED) {
            dist[i][j] = newDist;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  // Check if there are negative cycles.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // If the distance from a node to itself is negative, then there is a
    // negative cycle.
    if (dist[i][i] < 0) {
      System.out.println("negative cycle");
    }
  }

  return dist;
