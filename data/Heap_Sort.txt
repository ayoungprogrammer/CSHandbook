## Introduction

Heap sort is a sort that inserts all the element in an array into a min heap and then pops all the element outs. Since a heap guarantees that the root node will be the smallest element, we can store the entire array in a heap and the order that they are popped out of the heap will be in order.

### Prerequisites

* [[Heap]]

### Implementation

[[[[
public void heapSort(int[] arr){
    PriorityQueue<Integer> pq; //built in heap
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       pq.push(arr[i]);
    }
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       arr[i] = pq.pop(i);
    }
}
]]]]
