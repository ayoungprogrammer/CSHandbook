## Introduction

Recursion can sometimes be very difficult to wrap your head around because when you try to go deeper, it only keeps getting deeper. It is sometimes hard to figure out the recurrence relation, but once you do, the problem becomes simple to write.

## Number of paths

Let's say we have a grid of N rows and M columns. How many ways are there to get from the bottom left corner to the top right corner using the intersection points and only going upwards or rightwards?

{{recursion_grid.png}}

We see that the only way to reach an intersection is to come from the left intersection or come from the bottom intersection. So the number of ways to reach an intersection is the number of ways to reach the intersection to the left plus the number of ways to reach the intersection on the right. 

So more accurately, the number of ways to get to intersection N x M is the sum of the ways to get to the intersection N-1 x M and the intersection N x M-1. However, the number of ways to reach the intersection N-1 x M is the sum of the number of ways to the intersection N-2 x M and N-1 x M-1. As we can see, it is a recurrence relation. 

The base case is the starting intersection in the bottom left hand corner (the intersection 1x1) which is the only way to reach that intersection. We can also see that there is only one way to reach the intersections on the left side. There is only one way to reach the intersections on the bottom side as well.

Let ways(x,y) be the number of ways to get to the intersection at x and y

Base case:
ways(1,y) = 1
ways(x,1) = 1

Recurrence:
ways(x,y) = ways(x-1,y) + ways(x,y-1)

## [[Towers of Hanoi]]

There are three poles and N disks where each disk is heaver than the next disk. In the initial configuration, the discs are stacked upon another on the first pole where the lighter discs are above the heavier discs. We want to move all the discs to the last pole with the following conditions:

* Only be moved from one pole to another one at a time.
* The discs have to be stacked such that all the lighter discs are on top of the heavier ones.

Lets' try to make this problem simpler. To move N discs from the first pole the the last pole we need to move N-1 discs to the middle pole, then move the Nth disc to the last pole, and then move all N-1 discs from the middle pole back on to the last pole.

Let the starting pole be the first pole, the helper pole be the middle pole and the destination pole the third pole.

{{hanoi.png}}

To move N discs from the starting pole to the destination pole:

**Step 1:**

We need to move N-1 discs from the starting pole to the helper pole.
{{hanoi2.png}}

**Step 2:**

We need to move the Nth disc from the starting pole to the destination pole.
{{hanoi3.png}}

**Step 3:**

We need to move N-1 discs from the helper pole to the destination pole.
{{hanoi4.png}}

We can see that Step 2 is easy, all we have to do is move that one disc. But for Step 1 and Step 3, we have to move N-1 discs. How can we move N-1 discs to the middle pole? 

We see that we can use the same reasoning: we need to move N-2 discs to the third pole. Then we need to move the N-1 disc to the second pole and then move N-2 discs from the third pole to the second pole.

In this case, the start pole is the first pole, the helper pole is the third pole and the destination pole is the middle pole.

{{hanoi.png}}

To move N-1 discs from starting pole to destination pole:

**Step 1:**

We need to move N-2 discs from starting pole to helper pole

{{hanoi5.png}}

**Step 2:**

We move the N-1th disc from the starting pole to the destination pole

{{hanoi6.png}}

**Step 3:**

We move N-2 discs from the helper pole to the destination pole.

{{hanoi2.png}}

As we can see, the steps to move N discs are the exact same as to move N-1 discs! The only difference is that the actual poles are different but if we reassign poles to new roles every time we move down a disc, we can build a recurrence relation. 

In Step 1, when we move N-1 discs from start to helper, the new helper is the old destination and the new destination is the old helper.

In Step 3, when we move N-1 discs from the helper to the destination, the new helper is the start pole, and the new start pole is the helper

[[[[{lang-html}
Let f(N,start,helper,dest) be the steps to move N discs from the start to dest

Base case:
f(1,start,helper,dest)= Move from (start) to (dest)

Recurrence:
f(N,start,helper,dest)

=

f(N-1,start,dest,helper)
Move from start to dest
f(N-1,helper,start,dest)

Example:
Let A, B, C be pole 1, 2, 3

f(4,A,B,C) 

=

f(3,A,C,B)
Move from A to C
f(3,B,A,C)

## Permutations

A permutation is an arrangement of the original set of elements.

For example permutations of A,B,C,D,E,F:

* D,E,F,C,B,A
* F,C,D,B,A,E
* B,D,A,E,F,C
* A,B,C,D,E,F

Given a string S of length N, how can we generate all permutations?

Let's assume that we have a list of permutations for the substring of S of N-1 characters. Then to get the permutations for the string of length N, all we need to do is insert the Nth character in between all the positions of each permutation of N-1 characters. For example permutation of A,B,C,D.

We can manually find the permutations of A,B,C.

* A,B,C
* A,C,B
* B,A,C
* B,C,A
* C,A,B
* C,B,A

If we insert the letter D between each letter for every permutation we get:

* D,A,B,C
* A,D,B,C
* A,B,D,C
* A,B,C,D
* D,A,C,B
* A,D,C,B
* A,C,D,B
* A,C,B,D
.... etc

And we can guarantee that every new permutation will be unique. (Try to prove that to yourself).

But let's look at how we can get the permutation of A,B,C. We can also get all the permutations of the string by taking the permutations of A,B and inserting C in all the positions for all substrings.

Substrings of A,B

* A, B
* B, A

Insert C for all positions for all permutations

* C,A,B
* A,C,B
* A,B,C
* C,B,A
* B,C,A
* C,B,A

We see that we have a recurrence relation. To get the permutations of a string N, we take the string[1..N-1] and we insert the Nth character at every position for each permutation of the N-1 substring. The base case of an empty string is simply an empty string. Permutation of an empty string is an empty list.

For simplicity, S[i..j] will mean the substring from including i to excluding j.

[[[[{lang-html}
Let P(S) be the list of permutations for the string S of length N

Base case:
P('') = []

Recurrence:
Let N = length of string S
P(S) = ps[0..i] + S[N] + ps[i..N] for i in 0..N, for ps in P(S[0..N-1])

Example:
P('ABC')

Implementation
[[[[
Vector<String> permutation(String s){
   int n = s.length;
   Vector<String> vec = new Vector<String>();
   if(s.length==0)return vec;
   Vector<String> subvec = permutation(s.substring(0,n-1));
   for(int i=0;i<subvec.size();i++){
      String ps = subvec.get(i);
      for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
         vec.push(ps.substring(0,j)+s.charAt(n)+ps.substring(j,n-1));
      }
   }
   return vec;
}
]]]]


## Exercises

1. Given a string S, write a recursive function to generate all substrings
2. Write a solution for hanoi towers but with the restriction that discs can only be moved from adjacent poles. (You can move a disc from A to B but not A to C because they are not adjacent)
