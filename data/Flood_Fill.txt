## Introduction

**Prerequisites**: [[Depth First Search]], [[Breadth First Search]]

Flood fill is a search that fills a grid from a start point to find the areas connected to the start point. For example the "bucket fill" in Photoshop or MS Paint uses flood fill to fill in the connecting areas with the same colour.

Flood fill can be implemented using a BFS or DFS.

## General solution

Most flood fill solutions follow the same basic layout. There is a general [[DFS|Depth First Search]] solution and a general [[BFS|Breadth First Search]] solution.

### General DFS

[[[[
//marked is initially a n by m boolean array of false
void floodFill(int i,int j){
   if(outOfBounds(i,j))return;
   if(visited(i,j))return;
   markVisited(i,j);
   floodFill(i+1,j);
   floodFill(i,j+1);
   floodFill(i-1,j);
   floodFill(i,j-1);
}
]]]]

### General BFS

[[[[
void floodFill(int i,int j){
   Queue<Point> q;
   q.push(new Point(i,j));
   while(!q.isEmpty()){
      Point cur = q.pop();
      if(outOfBounds(cur))continue;
      if(visited(cur))continue;
      markVisited(cur);
      q.push(new Point(cur.x+1,cur.y));
      q.push(new Point(cur.x-1,cur.y));
      q.push(new Point(cur.x,cur.y+1));
      q.push(new Point(cur.x,cur.y-1));
   }
   
}
]]]]

## Bucket Fill

Given an n x m matrix and a start point and two colors (src and dst), we want to replace all the cells in the matrix that are connected to the start point with the color src and change to color dst as well as output the number of cells changed.

Example:

{{bucket.png}}

{{bucket2.png}}

In a numeric representation of the colors:

{{bucket3.png}}

{{bucket4.png}}

### DFS Solution

This is the [[DFS|Depth First Search]] approach to the problem.

* Assume that n,m are global integers that are the width and height of the image
* Assume that image is a global integer n by m matrix for the image
* Assume that visited is a global boolean n by m matrix that is initially all false

[[[[
/* Changes all pixels that are equal to src to tar that are connected to start
 * and returns the number of pixels changed
 */
public int FloodFillDFS(int x,int y,int src,int tar){
	if(x<0 || x>=n || y<0 || y>=m)return 0;
	if(visited[x][y])return 0;
	visited[x][y] = true;
	if(image[x][y]!=src)return 0;
	image[x][y] = tar;
	int sum = 0;
	sum+=FloodFillDFS(x+1,y,src,tar);
	sum+=FloodFillDFS(x-1,y,src,tar);
	sum+=FloodFillDFS(x,y+1,src,tar);
	sum+=FloodFillDFS(x,y-1,src,tar);
	return sum;
}

floodFillDFS(1,1,1,2);
]]]]

### BFS Solution

This is the [[BFS|Breadth First Search]] approach to the problem.

* Assume that n,m are global integers that are the width and height of the image
* Assume that image is a global integer n by m matrix for the image
* Assume that visited is a global boolean n by m matrix that is initially all false

[[[[
/* Changes all pixels that are equal to src to tar that are connected to start
 * and returns the number of pixels changes 
 */
public int FloodFillBFS(int x,int y,int src,int tar){
	LinkedList<Point> q = new LinkedList<Point>();
	q.push(new Point(x,y));
	int total = 0;
	while(q.isEmpty()==false){
		Point cur = q.pop();
		if(cur.x<0||cur.x>=n||cur.y<0||cur.y>=m)continue;
		if(visited[cur.x][cur.y])continue;
                visited[cur.x][cur.y] = true;
		if(image[cur.x][cur.y]!=src)continue;
		image[cur.x][cur.y] = tar;
		total++;
		q.push(new Point(cur.x+1,cur.y));
		q.push(new Point(cur.x-1,cur.y));
		q.push(new Point(cur.x,cur.y+1));
		q.push(new Point(cur.x,cur.y-1));
	}
	return total;
}
FloodFillBFS(1,1,1,2);

## Exercises

1. Given a grid and list of start points and walls, find the distance to the closest start point for every non-wall grid space without passing through a wall.
2. Given a grid and list of cell coordinates, find the perimeter around the cells
  * Example: a single cell has a perimeter of 4, two cells joined side by side have a perimeter of 6
