## Introduction

Sorting is arranging an array of n elements in either increasing or decreasing order by some property. It is very useful in computer science for efficiency in other algorithms that usually require a search.

A stable sort is a sort that can preserve sorting of other properties. For example if we have 

(3,G), (1,G), (3, A), (6 K), (1,B) 

and we want to sort by the first property in increasing order, we will have: 

(1, G) (1,B) (3,G), (3,A) (6 K). 

If we sort again by the second property we have (1,B) (3, A) (1, G) (3, G) (6,K) then the sort is stable as the first sort is preserved. However if we had (1,B) (3, A) (3, G) (1, G) (6, K), then the sort would be unstable.
