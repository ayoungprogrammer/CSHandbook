## Introduction

**Prerequisites**:  [[Sorting]], [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]

Kruskal's algorithm finds the [[minimum spanning tree|Minimum Spanning Tree]] using [[connected components|Connected Components]].

If Kruskal's algorithm is implemented efficiently using a priority queue, the runtime is O(n log n).

## Implementation

1. Uniquely label each node.
2. Take the edge with the minimum weight.
3. If the edge connects nodes A and B with different labels, all nodes with label B will be labeled with A. Otherwise, throw the edge away.
4. Repeat 2-3 until all the nodes have the same label.

### Example

We first start with each node uniquely labelled as a letter.

We first start with the edge with the smallest weight of 2 which was between A and B. We add B to A's component by labelling B as A.

The next edge with the smallest weight is 5 which connects to C. We add C to A's component by labelling it as A.

There is a tie between edges with the smallest weight of 6 and it doesn't matter which one we take. For the purpose of this example we will take the edge between D and G. We add G to D's component be labelling it as D.

Next we take the other edge with weight 6. We are connecting the D and A components, thus we can label all the nodes with D as A.

The next edge with smallest weight is 7 but it does not connect two different components, thus we discard the edge. The next two edges have weights 8 and we can randomly pick the edge to E. We add E to A's component by labelling it as A.

We take the other edge with weight 8 to F and add F to A's component by relabelling it as A.

All the nodes are the same label and all part of the same component, thus by the algorithm, we have our minimum spanning tree.

### Code

We can implement Kruskal's algorithm efficiently by using connected components. 

[[[[
class edge implements Comparable<edge> {
	int weight,source,dest;
	public edge(int source,int dest,int weight) {
		this.source = source;
		this.dest = dest;
		this.weight = weight;
	}
	public int compareTo(edge e) {
		return weight-e.weight;
	}
}
public static int getParent(int parents[], int x) {
  // Base Case: parent of x is itself.
  if (parents[x] == x) {
    return x;
  }
  // Set current's parent to highest parent.
  parents[x] = getParent(parents, parents[x]);

  // Returns parent.
  return parents[x];
}

public static int Kruskal(Vector<Vector<edge>> adjList) {
  int n = adjList.size();
  // Parents of each node. Nodes with the same parents are in the same
  // component.
  int parents[] = new int[n];

  // Set parents of each node to itself.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    parents[i] = i;
  }

  int sum = 0;
  PriorityQueue<edge> edges = new PriorityQueue<edge>();

  // Iterate through each node.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Iterate through edges of node.
    for (int j = 0; j < adjList.get(i).size(); j++) {
      // Add edge to priority queue.
      edges.add(adjList.get(i).get(j));
    }
  }

  // Iterate through all edges.
  while (!edges.isEmpty()) {
    // Get edge with smallest weight.
    edge e = edges.poll();
    // Take edge if highest parent of source and destination nodes are
    // different i.e. take the edge if it connects different components
    if (getParent(parents, e.source) != getParent(parents, e.dest)) {
      // Set parent of source to highest parent of destination node.
      parents[e.source] = getParent(parents, e.dest);
      
      // Add edge weight to MST weight.
      sum += e.weight;
    }
  }

  // Return MST weight.
  return sum;
}
