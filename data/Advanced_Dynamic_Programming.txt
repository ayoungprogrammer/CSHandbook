## Introduction

*Prerequisites*: [[Dynamic Programming]]

Dynamic programming is very powerful and more efficient than recursion for problems that recompute multiple values. However sometimes it is difficult to find an efficient dynamic programming solution and we will examine problems where we will need higher dimensions.

## [[Zero-One Knapsack Problem]]

In the [[Dynamic Programming]] section, we examined the knapsack problem:

Given an unlimited amount of N items with positive weights and values, we want to find the maximum value we can hold with a capacity.

Let's change the problem slightly such that there is only one of each object. The problem becomes slightly more difficult because we need to take into account whether or not we have used an object before. 

Given only one copy of N items with positive weights and values, we want to find the maximum value we can hold with a capacity W.

The base case is simple, if there are no more items or total capacity is less than or equal to 0 then the maximum value is 0. Suppose we have items remaining and total capacity is positive. We can either take or leave the first item and we want the maximum value of both actions. If we take the item, the value will be the value of the item plus the maximum value of the rest of the items that fit in the rest of the space in the knapsack minus the space of the item we took. If we leave the item, the value will be the maximum value of the rest of the items that fit in the knapsack. Thus we have our recurrence relation.

[[[[
Let knapsack(items[], W) be the maximum value of items that fit in a maximum capacity of W.
Let N be the number of items.

Base case:
knapsack(items[], w) = 0 if w <= 0
knapsack([], w) = 0

Recursion:
takeValue = knapsack(items[1..N], w - items[0].weight) + items[0].value
leaveValue = knapsack(items[1..N], w)
knapsack(items[], w) = max(takeValue, leaveValue)
]]]]

However, we are recomputing multiple values and we can eliminate this by building the solution upwards using dynamic programming.

[[[[
Let knapsack[N][W] be the maximum value of N items that fit in a maximum capacity of W.
Let items be an array of N items with positive weights and values.

for i from 0 to W
  knapsack[0][i] = 0

for n from 1 to N
  knapsack[n][0] = 0
  for w from 1 to W
    takeValue = knapsack[n - 1][w - item[n - 1].weight] + item[n - 1].value
    leaveValue = knapsack[n - 1][w]
    knapsack[n][w] = max(takeValue, leaveValue)
