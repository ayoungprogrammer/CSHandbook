## Introduction

*Prerequeisites*: [[Maps]], [[Binary Search Tree]]

A tree map is a map which stores the values in a [[binary search tree|Binary Search Tree]]. To store elements in a tree map, they must be able to be sorted by a property. To insert an element, it is added to the binary tree. To delete an element, it is removed from the binary tree. To check for membership, we do a binary search for the element in the binary tree.

The advantage of tree maps is that they are maps maintained in a sorted order.

Tree Maps are implemented using [[binary search trees|Binary Search Tree]]. Since much of the code is the same, we will not go in depth in an implementation.

## Exercise

1. Implement a Tree Map following the code of [[Binary Search Tree]] and [[Hash Map]].
