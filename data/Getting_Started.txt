## Introduction

The Computer Science handbook is a handbook designed to explain algorithms and data structures in a way that anyone can understand. Many websites (eg Wikipedia) contain lengthy and wordy explanations that are full of technical jargon. We have tried our hardest to simplify all language to make it easy to read without any math or computer science background. We hope to share our knowledge with you and we ask only one thing from you. You must learn something before you leave!

Before you get started with this handbook, it is highly recommended that you are already familiar with Java or C++ syntax. This handbook is not meaning for learning programming basics as other resources are better suited for that task.

## Format

Each article with have multiple sections to help you understand the content.

### Introduction

The introduction section gives a brief overview of what the article is about. It will usually come with a prerequisite section which will contain topics that will be recommended to have been read before the article.

### Implementation

The implementation section will be an implementation of the article in Java. It is recommended that you try to implement things yourself first before looking at the implementation. If you truly understand the concept, then you will never have to memorize a single line of code. The code will come from your understanding of how it works. 

### Applications

The applications section will be about real world applications of the concept that show why the concept is important.

### Exercises

The exercises section contains practice problems to test if you truly understand the concept. Many of these questions come from real interview questions.
