## Introduction

Searches are used to find solutions to problems and there many ways to search for a solution. Here are some generic searches that can be applied to many different problems. 

## [[Binary Search]]

Binary search is a type of search that is able to find an object in a sorted list in O(log n). In binary search we first start at the middle element and we keep trying to halve the problem until we find the element we need.

## [[Ternary Search]]

Ternary search is a type of search that finds the maximum value of a increasing or decreasing function by breaking it into 3 parts.

## [[Depth First Search]]

Depth first search or DFS is a method of search that goes as far as possible before backtracking. DFS is implemented using a [[stack|Stack]] and most of the time it uses an function stack for recursion.

## [[Breadth First Search]]

Breadth first search or BFS is a method of search that takes the closest things first then the farthest. BFS is implemented with a [[queue|Queue]].

## [[Flood Fill]]

Flood fill is a search that fills a grid. It can be implemented with either DFS or BFS. We first start at some starting position and then we expand in the directions that we can (eg: up, left, down, right).

## [[Backtracking]]
Backtracking is a search that enumerates every single possible solution by using partial solutions.
